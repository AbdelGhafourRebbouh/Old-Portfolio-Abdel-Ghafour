## 🌱 Learning Notes

This project was an important step in my growth.  
At that time, I was expanding from purely design into web development: learning frontend layout, responsive design, JavaScript basics, and using React.  
It helped me improve my visual design sense (logos, print, branding) and web UI/UX skills.

## 🔭 Where I Am Now

Though this portfolio was built earlier, I’ve since moved my focus toward **backend development with .NET (C#)** to become a **desktop developer**, while keeping my experience with **C++** strong.  
This old portfolio serves as proof of where I started and what I can improve.
